# Fun
***This repository contains various Python programs that I created as part of my hobby. These programs help me solve school-level problems and make my homework a little more fun and manageable.***

**Tempertaure Coverter.py** = I created this temperature unit converter while studying chemistry because I kept Googling conversions. Itâ€™s something I made to make things easier.
**DoOrDie.py** = I Created this as I watched it in a short video so i thought to recreate this to do fun with friends.
